purpose = <p>The last step of the SQUARE process, requirements inspection, is one of the most important elements in creating a set of accurate and verifiable security requirements. Inspection can be done at varying levels of formality, from Fagan Inspections to peer reviews. The goal of any inspection method, however, is to find any defects in the requirements such as ambiguities, inconsistencies, or mistaken assumptions.</p><p>See information on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fagan_inspection">Fagan Inspection</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201734850?ie=UTF8&tag=nevletdowdotn-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0201734850">Peer Reviews in Software by Karl Wiegers</a> for more information on inspections.</p>
stakeholderResponsibilities = <p>Come to a consensus on the validity of each security requirement. Verify that each requirement is verifiable, in scope, within financial means, and feasible to implement. Requirements that do not fit these criteria should have been identified in earlier stages of SQUARE, but the stakeholders should use this opportunity as a last chance to remove any requirements from the working set.</p>  
requirementsEngineerResponsibilities = <p>Facilitate the inspection process by providing any orientation to the structured inspection technique or informal inspection guides such as checklists.</p> 
exitCriteria = <p>All security requirements have been verified both by the requirements engineering team and the stakeholders. At this point the SQUARE process is complete, and the requirements engineering team can produce the final security requirements document for the stakeholders.</p>
webHint = <p>Inspection is a powerful tool that is often skipped due to the perception that it is a wasted time.  This tool provides resources and acts as a checkpoint that must be passed in order to download the final requirements list.</p>
