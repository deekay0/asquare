purpose = <p>The purpose of this step is to allow the requirements engineer and stakeholders to classify the requirements as essential, non-essential, system level, software level, or as architectural constraints. The requirements engineering team can provide to the stakeholders a matrix such as the one in Table 4 to assist in this process.</p><p>The categories in Table 4 are not fixed; each iteration of SQUARE will likely produce a much larger set of categories that are customized to the project at hand. These categories are instead suggested as a minimal set.</p><p>Since the goal of SQUARE is to produce security requirements, the requirements engineering team and stakeholders should avoid producing architectural constraints. Architectural constraints are provided as a category here to serve as an outlet for requirements that, upon categorization, are considered to be constraints. Ideally, such anomalies would be identified and corrected in the previous steps of the process.</p><p>Once the requirements are categorized, the requirements engineering team and stakeholders will be able to prioritize them more efficiently.</p> 
stakeholderResponsibilities = <p>Reach a consensus on the categorization for each requirement.</p> 
requirementsEngineerResponsibilities = <p><ul><li>Provide a baseline set of categories. The team may have to suggest alternative categories, depending on the client project. </li><li>Facilitate the stakeholders categorization process. </li></ul></p>
exitCriteria = <p>The initial set of requirements has been organized into project-defined categories, and any remaining architectural constraints are identified as such.</p>    
webHint = <p>This tool uses  "tagging" to make it easy to quickly add requirements to a variety of categories.</p>
