purpose = <p>case 3 step 5 Please add purpose for case 3 step 5. In order to guarantee effective and clear communication throughout the requirements engineering process, the requirements engineering team and stakeholders must first agree on a common set of terminology and definitions. </p><p>Given the differences in expertise, knowledge, and experience, an arbitrary term may have multiple meanings between the participants in the SQUARE process. In addition, there may be ambiguity in the level of detail that is assumed for a given term. For instance, one stakeholder may view "access controls" as a set of policies that governs which users may be granted access to which resources. Another stakeholder may view access controls as the software elements in the system that actually implement this functionality. These differences in perspective must be resolved before the process can continue. </p> 
stakeholderResponsibilities = <ul><li>case 3 step 5 Please add something for case 3 step 5. Use this tool to identify security terms and definitions provided by the requirements engineering team. All stakeholders should come up to speed on each definition in a timely manner and notify the RE team when they are ready to move on.</li><li>Establish a single point of contact (POC) for interaction between the requirements engineering team and the stakeholders.</li></ul>  
requirementsEngineerResponsibilities = <ul><li>case 1 step 4 Provide an initial set of terms with corresponding suggested definitions.

exitCriteria = <p>case 3 step 5 Please add something for case 3 step 5. A well-documented, agreed-on set of definitions has been established and is available to all stakeholders and the requirements engineering team. The definitions document will be used as a reference throughout the rest of the SQUARE process.</p>     
webHint = <p>case 3 step 5 Please add something for case 3 step 5. This tool will store an easily referable list of terms and definitions that will form a common vocabulary throughout the execution of the SQUARE Method.</p>
