purpose = <p>case 1 step 4 In order to guarantee effective and clear communication throughout the requirements engineering process, the requirements engineering team and stakeholders must first agree on a common set of terminology and definitions. </p><p>Given the differences in expertise, knowledge, and experience, an arbitrary term may have multiple meanings between the participants in the SQUARE process. In addition, there may be ambiguity in the level of detail that is assumed for a given term. For instance, one stakeholder may view "access controls" as a set of policies that governs which users may be granted access to which resources. Another stakeholder may view access controls as the software elements in the system that actually implement this functionality. These differences in perspective must be resolved before the process can continue. </p>
