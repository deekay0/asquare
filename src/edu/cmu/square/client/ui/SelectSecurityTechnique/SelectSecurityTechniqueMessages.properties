purpose = <p>The requirements engineering team must select an elicitation technique that is suitable for the client organization and project. Although this task may appear to be straightforward, it is often the case that multiple techniques will likely work for the same project. The difficulty is in choosing a technique that can adapt to the number and expertise of stakeholders, size and scope of the client project, and expertise of the requirements engineering team. It is extremely unlikely that any single technique will work for all projects under all circumstances, though previous experience has shown that the Accelerated Requirements Method (ARM) has been successful in eliciting security requirements. This particular technique is discussed further in Section 4.7.2 of the <a href="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/publications/documents/05.reports/05tr009.html" target="new">Security Quality Requirements Engineering (SQUARE) Methodology report from the Software Engineering Institute</a>.</p><p>The following is a sample of elicitation techniques that may be appropriate:<ul><li>Structured/unstructured interviews</li><li>Use/misuse cases</li><li>Joint Application Development</li><li>Accelerated Requirements Method</li><li>Soft Systems Methodology</li><li>Issue-Based Information Systems</li><li>Quality Function Deployment</li><li>Feature-Oriented Domain Analysis</li><li>Controlled Requirements Expression</li><li>Critical Discourse Analysis</li><li>Privacy Requirements Elicitation Method</li></ul></p>

requirementsEngineerResponsibilities = <ul><li>Select an elicitation technique that is appropriate for the number and expertise of stake-holders, size and scope of the project, and expertise of the requirements engineering team.</li><li>Document the rationale for the choice and make necessary preparations to execute the technique.</li></ul> 
exitCriteria = <p>The requirements engineering team has selected an appropriate elicitation technique and documented the rationale for their choice.</p>  
webHint = <p>In the tool, a requirements engineer will assign values to rate each technique in terms of the given evaluation criteria.  The tool will use this information to generate a comparison matrix and recommend the technique to be used.  The Lead Requirements Engineer may modify the techniques and evaluation criteria for the project from the Project''s settings dashboard.</p>
