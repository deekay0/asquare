purpose = <p>In most cases, the client organization will be unable to implement all of the security requirements due to lack of time, resources, or developing changes in the goals of the project. Thus, the purpose of this step in the SQUARE process is to prioritize the security requirements so that the stakeholders can choose which requirements to implement and in what order. The results of Step 4, the risk assessment, and Step 7, categorization, are crucial inputs to this step.</p><p>The available prioritization methods are flexible and can be as simple as unstructured deliberation between the stakeholders. There are several structured prioritization techniques that exist, such as Triage, Win-Win, and the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP); the latter has been reported to be quite effective. Ideally, the requirements engineering team should also produce a cost-benefit analysis to aid the stakeholders'' decisions.</p><p>It may be the case that, during prioritization, some of the requirements may be deemed to be entirely infeasible to implement. In such cases, the requirements engineering team has a choice\: completely dismiss the requirement from further consideration, or document the requirement as "future work" and remove it from the working set of project requirements. This decision should be made after consulting with the stakeholders.</p>
