purpose = <p>Before the requirements engineering team and stakeholders can generate a comprehensive set of security requirements, the team must collect a complete set of artifacts of the system. The following are the types of artifacts that should be collected:</p><ul><li>System architecture diagrams</li><li>Use case scenarios/diagrams</li><li>Misuse case scenarios/diagrams</li><li>Attack trees</li><li>Standardized templates and forms</li></ul><p>In developing such artifacts, it is important to enlist the assistance of knowledgeable engineers from the organization. In some cases, it is possible that the client organization will not have any of the artifacts in place, including such basic items as system architecture diagrams. In such situations, the requirements engineering team should reiterate to the stakeholders that by creating and documenting artifacts of the system, they are investing in the success of the project.</p>
stakeholderResponsibilities = <p>Generate or collect any system artifacts and present them to the requirements engineering team. This information includes system architectures, actors, use/misuse cases, and suspected attacks. It is possible that other experts from within the organization may be called upon to provide information as well.  Stakeholders should also verify the accuracy and completeness of artifacts.</p>  
requirementsEngineerResponsibilities = <p>Work with the stakeholders and client organization to identify and collect as many artifacts as possible.  The requirements engineering team should also verify the accuracy and completeness of artifacts.</p>

exitCriteria = <p>A set of artifacts for the system, as complete as possible, has been generated by the requirements engineering team and shared with the stakeholders.</p>
webHint = <p>Artifacts are generated outside of the tool but this tool will hold a reference (usually a hyperlink to an online repository) to all required artifacts.  This will make it easier to keep a record of the artifacts and versions of artifacts used to gather security requirements for the system.</p>
