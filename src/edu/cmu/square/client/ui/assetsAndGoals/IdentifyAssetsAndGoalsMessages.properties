purpose = <p>The purpose of Step 2 in SQUARE is for the stakeholders to formally agree on a set of prioritized security goals and assets to be protected for the project. Without overall security goals for the project, it is impossible to identify the priority and relevance of any security requirements that are generated. In addition, the establishment of security goals scopes the rest of the SQUARE process.</p><p>Initially, different stakeholders will likely have different security goals, and different views of the important assets to be protected. For example, a member of human resources may be concerned about maintaining the confidentiality of personnel records, whereas a stakeholder in finance may be concerned with ensuring that financial data is not modified without authorization. The security goals of the stakeholders may also conflict with one another. A security-conscious stakeholder may place high importance on strong security controls for the system, which in turn may hamper overall system performance. Decreased performance might likely be at odds with the goals of the marketing department. This step in the SQUARE process serves to eliminate such conflicts and align all of the stakeholders'' interests.</p><p>The security goals of the project must be in clear support of the project''s overall business goal, which also must be identified in this step. On average, stakeholders should attempt to brainstorm to come up with approximately half a dozen security goals for the project, with more or less depending on the scale of the project. The assets and the security goals are mapped to one another, but not necessarily in a one-to-one manner. That is several security goals may be associated with a single asset, and several assets may be protected by a single security goal.</p><p>Once the goals of the various stakeholders have been identified, they must be prioritized. In the absence of consensus, an executive decision may be needed to prioritize the goals. The assets to be protected must be identified and associated with the security goals.  Some iteration may be needed to complete this.  Finally, the requirements engineering team must encourage the stakeholders to generate security goals as opposed to requirements or recommendations. There is a fine line between a security goal such as "The system shall be available for use when needed," a requirement such as "The system must have a continuity of operations plan in place to ensure appropriate system availability," and a recommendation such as "Invest in backup information technology hardware to ensure business continuity." The requirements engineering team must act as the experts in this situation, providing assistance to the stakeholders so that they may generate an appropriately scoped set of security requirements.</p> 
stakeholderResponsibilities = <ul><li>Identify a single business goal for the project. This goal should be stated in one sentence, such as the system shall provide the means to effectively manage company resources in a disaster situation.</li><li>Brainstorm and create approximately half a dozen security goals that are in clear support of the business goal. For example, the system shall maintain high availability, even in the face of public utility failures.</li><li>Prioritize the security goals.</li><li>Identify the assets to be protected in conjunction with the security goals.</li><li>Provide the business goal, security goals, and assets to the requirements engineering team for review, and edit the goals and assets as deemed necessary by the team.</li></ul>
requirementsEngineerResponsibilities = <ul><li>Facilitate the brainstorm session by the stakeholders, emphasizing the importance of creating a single business goal, followed by several security goals that support it. Assets should be identified in conjunction with security goals.</li><li>Review the stakeholders'' business and security goals, and assets, providing any feedback on scope, level of detail, and relevance to the business goal of the project.</li><li>Document and share the finalized business goal and corresponding security goals and assets.</li></ul>
exitCriteria = <p>A single business goal for the project and several prioritized security goals that support it have been established. The assets to be protected have also been identified and associated with the security goals.</p>
