purpose = <p>The purpose of Step 2 in ASQUARE is for the acquisition organization engineer(case 1) or the security specialist(case 3) to formally agree on a set of prioritized security goals and assets to be protected for the project. Without overall security goals for the project, it is impossible to identify the priority and relevance of any security requirements that are generated. In addition, the establishment of security goals scopes the rest of the ASQUARE process.</p><p>Initially, different participants will likely have different security goals, and different views of the important assets to be protected. For example, a member of human resources may be concerned about maintaining the confidentiality of personnel records, whereas a stakeholder in finance may be concerned with ensuring that financial data is not modified without authorization. The security goals of the participants may also conflict with one another. A security-conscious participant may place high importance on strong security controls for the system, which in turn may hamper overall system performance. Decreased performance might likely be at odds with the goals of the marketing department. This step in the ASQUARE process serves to eliminate such conflicts and align all of the participants'' interests.</p><p>The security goals of the project must be in clear support of the project''s overall business goal, which also must be identified in this step. On average, participants should attempt to brainstorm to come up with approximately half a dozen security goals for the project, with more or less depending on the scale of the project. The assets and the security goals are mapped to one another, but not necessarily in a one-to-one manner. That is several security goals may be associated with a single asset, and several assets may be protected by a single security goal.</p><p>Once the goals of the various participants have been identified, they must be prioritized. In the absence of consensus, an executive decision may be needed to prioritize the goals. The assets to be protected must be identified and associated with the security goals.  Some iteration may be needed to complete this.  Finally, the acquisition organization engineer must encourage the other participants to generate security goals as opposed to requirements or recommendations. There is a fine line between a security goal such as "The system shall be available for use when needed," a requirement such as "The system must have a continuity of operations plan in place to ensure appropriate system availability," and a recommendation such as "Invest in backup information technology hardware to ensure business continuity."</p>
