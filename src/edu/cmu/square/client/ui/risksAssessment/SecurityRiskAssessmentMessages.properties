purpose = <p>The purpose of this step in the SQUARE process is to identify the vulnerabilities and threats that face the system, as well as the likelihood that the threats will materialize as real attacks. Without a risk assessment, organizations can be tempted to implement security requirements or countermeasures without a logical rationale. For instance, the stakeholders may decide that encryption is a necessary component of their system without fully understanding the nature of the problem that encryption can solve. The risk assessment also serves to prioritize the security requirements at a later stage in the process.</p><p>There are a growing number of risk assessment methods from which to choose. Some of the methods are very structured and may require the assistance of an external risk expert. Ideally, this expert would already be a part of the project team.</p><p>After the threats have been identified by the risk assessment method, they must be classified according to likelihood. Again, this will aid in prioritizing the security requirements that are generated at a later stage.</p>

webHint = <p>This tool assumes the NIST risk assessment process will be used to analyze risks <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-30/sp800-30.pdf">(PDF)</a>. Since only the final risks are recorded in the tool by the requirements engineers, any risk process might be used.  While recording risks in the tool, the risks will be traced to assets and goals to assist with later analysis.</p>
